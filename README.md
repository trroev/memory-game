## How It's Made:

**Built with:**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started:

```
git clone https://github.com/trroev/memory-game.git
cd resume-app
npm install
npm start
```

## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun app to build to get more familiar with hooks, especially useEffect. I learned that it seems a little easier to create css style components as well, rather than one large css file. Using logical comparisons in a prop and also a ternary operator for a jsx className were both new to me as well.
